# Node CRUD RESTful API

This project intends to practice on creating a CRUD RESTful API in a Node.js environment running on an Express.js server and using a PostgreSQL database. It connects an Express.js server with PostgreSQL using node-postgres. The API will be able to handle the HTTP request methods that correspond to the PostgreSQL database from which the API gets its data.

The aim of this project is to practice how to allow CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) on the API, which will run the corresponding database commands. To do this, it sets up a route for each endpoint and a function for each query.
